# Question

Write a function that, given:

- an amount of money
- an array of coin denominations
- computes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations.

Example: for `const amount = 4;` (4¢) and `const denominations = [1, 2, 3];`(1¢, 2¢ and 3¢), your program would output 4 — the number of ways to make 4¢ with those denominations:

```
1¢, 1¢, 1¢, 1¢
1¢, 1¢, 2¢
1¢, 3¢
2¢, 2¢
```

# Answer

```javascript
function compute(amount = 4, denominations = [1, 2, 3]) {
  if (amount === 0) return 1;
  if (amount < 0) return 0;

  let result = 0;

  for (const iter of denominations) {
    result += compute(amount - iter, denominations);
  }

  return result;
}

console.log(compute());
```
