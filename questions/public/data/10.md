# Question

Given an array called `stockPrices`, where:

- The indices are the time (in minutes) past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
- The values are the price (in CAD dollars) of one share of Apple stock at that time.

Write an efficient method that takes `stockPrices` and returns the best profit one could have made from one purchase and one sale of one share of Apple stock yesterday.

Output: 9

Input: [10, 5, 2, 1]
Ouput:

# Answer

```javascript
function stockPrices(input) {
  let profit = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < input.length; j++) {
      if (input[j] - input[i] > profit) {
        profit = input[j] - input[i];
      }
    }
  }

  return profit;
}

console.log(stockPrices([2, 1, 4, 10, 7]) === 9);
console.log(stockPrices([10, 5, 2, 1]) === 0);
console.log(stockPrices([10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]) === 6);
```

```javascript
function stockPrices(input) {
  let min = input[0];
  let profit = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < input.length; i++) {
    min = Math.min(min, input[i]);
    profit = Math.max(profit, input[i] - min);
  }

  return profit;
}

console.log(stockPrices([2, 1, 4, 10, 7]) === 9);
console.log(stockPrices([10, 5, 2, 1]) === 0);
console.log(stockPrices([10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]) === 6);
```
